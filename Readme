## units
- have used the units given in the example but also parameterized them 
- assumed that the units are the same for the whole board
- assumed that the user of this code would have already converted values represented in other units to the ones used here

## data types choice
- used simple data types that can provide predictable results
- for the quantity used BigDecimal instead of double (3.1 + 3.2 for example would have caused issues)
- for the price used long instead of double to represent the price value in cents
- in a more elaborate implementation would have used an external library to deal with quantities in various units of measure and prices in various currencies

## storage choice
- made the storage implementation as simple as possible without guarantees for immutability, concurrent access or performance
- a more elaborate implementation would have been to consider an append-only list and to logically remove elements by setting a flag
